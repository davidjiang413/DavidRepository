            <div> <p> *Where am I?* </p> <p> You stand, briefly stumbling before gaining your balance. Looking around, absorbing your surroundings, you attempt to remember what brought you to this foreign plain. The more you try, the further the answer gets. </p> <p> *...* </p> <p> You come to a startling realization. </p> <p> *...Who am I...?* </p> <p>"Now this is a surprise. I didn't expect you to come back so soon."</p> <p> A figure appears from behind where there was not a soul to be seen just seconds before.</p> <p> "Come with me to the tower..."</p></div>
