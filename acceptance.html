            <div><p>"Nice to see you aren't a complete coward. That'll help you pass. Now to see if you'll survive."</p> <p>Behind the stranger, a panther swirls into existence. From a distance it seemed like your average feline. Black, sleek coat. Pupils glaring against the evening sun. However upon closer inspection there was one obvious difference. Unlike your average panther, this one towered over nine feet tall.</p> <p>*...!*</p> <p>The panther prowls, patrolling the area around you. Step by step, it approaches nearer and nearer. It's panting sharply audible among whispering sighs from the plain.</p> <p>*Need a little help?*</p> <p>The voice comes as a surprise.</p> <p>*Look to your left. There should be a dagger there. Pick it up.*</p> <p>*Who is this...? How are you getting into my head...?!?*</p> <p>*No time to answer any questions. Just listen to... Pay attention you idiot! The panther's about to leap!*</p> <p>You realize your mistake as the panther propels itself towards you.</p></div>
